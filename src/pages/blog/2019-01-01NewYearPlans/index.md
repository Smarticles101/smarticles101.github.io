Today is the first day of a new year! Tons of fun.
I'm going to outline some plans for this year.

### 1. Finish high school

One more semester left of high school!

Classes I'm taking this semester:
* AP Calculus AB
* AP English Literature
* Choir
* Economics
* Ignite/Internship

I'm aiming for a 4 or 5 on my AP Calulus exam, but english
is a weaker area for me so I'm hoping for a 3.

### 2. Apply for scholarships

I would like to apply for a bunch of scholarships
before I head off to college. Hopefully I can get
people to pay for my education so I don't drown in
student loan debt :)

### 3. Get a summer internship and maybe a part time job

Last summer, I was able to intern with Walmart in
their infosec department. I'd love to be able to do
that again in a different area. If this works out, I'd
probably quit my current job at Sonic. I could also 
potentially turn an internship into a remote job while I'm in college.

### 4. Be more actively involved in open source

Currently, I am a member of [exercism](https://exercism.io). I
would like to more actively contribute there, or possibly
find some smaller projects I can contribute to. I might
even start my own if I can find a good idea.

### 5. College

I've applied to 3 different colleges for the 2019 fall semester.

I've chosen BYU as my primary choice, and am currently awaiting an 
admission decision, which I expect in Febuary.

BYU-Idaho is my backup, in case BYU doesn't work out or I don't
get the funds for it. Already accepted here.

University of Arkansas is my last fallback. If for some reason 
my other options don't follow through, I'll go here and stay
closer to home. I was also already accepted here.


### In closing

So yeah those are my plans for 2019 as they currently stand.

My main concerns for this year are grades as I finish high school,
and funding my college education.

Wish me luck! :)
