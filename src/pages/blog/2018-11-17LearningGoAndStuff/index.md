title: "Learning go and stuff"
---

I've been looking at learning Go for a few days now.

It feels similar to the time I've spent learning C++, but
the syntax feels more python-like in a way.

I've started finding it easier to pick up new languages.
Learning the syntax isn't an issue as long as I have examples
to follow, and most of the core concepts are the same
between languages.

The hard part of learning a new programming language, or really
just programming in general is finding out what you want to
code. I always want to code stuff but never feel like I have
great ideas. I remembered project euler and decided that would
be a fun thing to work on. So, I've been working on that some.

I already have the first 15 problems solved, the code is hosted
[here](https://github.com/Smarticles101/goEuler) if you want to
see it.

Go has been fun to learn because linting and a package manager
are built into the command line. It also has code testing
and benchmarks built in which feels nice having a "standard"
library for.

But yeah, I felt like I needed to give javascript a break for
a little bit. Maybe I'll do some more Java stuff soon or write
something with python cause I never really use that.

Anyways that's it for now, I'll post again later.
