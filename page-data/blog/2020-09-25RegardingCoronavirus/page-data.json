That's how long ago my school sent\nan official notice out, cancelling classes for the next two\ndays and then transitioning into remote classes over Zoom.\nHalf of our winter semester was completely online, then spring\nsemester was completely remote as well. Now, two weeks into Fall\nsemester, the school sends out a warning that campus will again\nclose if students do not adhere to guidlines set by the county.\nThe mandate orders for limited social gatherings and masks when\nyou cannot maintain 6-foot social distancing.</p>\n<p>Personally, I have been doing my best to follow these two simple\nrestrictions. My classes are online, so I avoid going to campus\nunless for the gym, where I wear a mask while working out. Other\nthan that, I will go out to buy groceries, where I also wear a mask.\nHowever, the problem becomes clear immediately when I see the few\npeople who have their mask below their nose, tucked under their chin,\nor completely removed from their face.</p>\n<p>I can only assume that these people who somehow cannot wear a mask right\nor even wear one at all must be either incredibly lazy, or inconsiderate\nto other peoples health. Then, there are the people on social media who\nexacerbate the issue by posting about conspiracy theories. Like how coronavirus\nwas invented by Bill Gates or the government. The people who apparently\nmissed 6th grade science class and cannot comprehend how viruses are real.</p>\n<p>I am normally a pretty easy-going person, but I cannot describe how I felt\nwhen I read the comments of people who are outgoingly against wearing a mask.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>BYU seriously needs to stop pushing this mask propaganda. Leave that for\nleft wing media like CNN.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Then there's a response to the above comment which was left on my universities\nInstagram page.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Amen! Y'all need to see the email byui just sent out about requiring students\nto comply with unconsititutional requirements by the county, threatening to\nkick people out of school whether they are disobeying the requirements on or\noff campus.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I cannot wrap my head around these responses. First off, \"mask propaganda?\" Why\ndo doctors and medical professionals wear masks? Is that propoganda too?\nWhat about being required to wear masks for the common good is \"unconstitutional?\" </p>\n<p>I never imagined that a global pandemic would somehow become a political issue.\nI believe that part of this is due to social circles limiting our view. Not only\nphysical social circles, but the artifical information circles that algorithms\ncreate for us. It is no secret that tech learns to show you stuff based on your\nprevious interactions and that over time, the information shown to you becomes\nbiased based off of that.</p>\n<p>Recently I've been getting notifications on nearly every platform reminding me\nto register to vote. I think that is a positive notification, but imagine\nwhat information we could spread like that? Rather than limiting what people can\nsee, show them everything. If there's anything school has taught me, it is\nthe importance of gathering information from sources with varying biases\nand forming your own opinion after reviewing each source. We need to be careful\nas to not limit people's views to a certain bias.</p>\n<p>Will my school close again? Maybe, we will see what happens with time. Hopefully\npeople learn to respect the health of others and follow set restrictions. Not\nonly are they legally required to, but it is the considerate thing to do. Similar\nto using lane change signals while driving.</p>\n<p>If you got this far, thanks for reading my jumbled thoughts. Feel free to reach out\nif you have questions or comments.
