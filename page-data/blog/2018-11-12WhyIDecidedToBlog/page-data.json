Just thoughts\nwritten down in my markdown editor.</p>\n<p>I don't really plan on migrating my blog somewhere else\nor adding a content management system or anything.\nI kinda like just being able to write in VSCode and\nto just push the site with git.</p>\n<p>So yeah, I'm trying to post a lot now. I know no one's\nreally reading these right now. Hopefully there's more\nlater, but if not it's okay as long as at least one\nperson reads it. I'll probably post less later and\nforget about the blog at some point. Life tends to\nget busy sometimes.
