I always want to code stuff but never feel like I have\ngreat ideas. I remembered project euler and decided that would\nbe a fun thing to work on. So, I've been working on that some.</p>\n<p>I already have the first 15 problems solved, the code is hosted\n<a href=\"https://github.com/Smarticles101/goEuler\">here</a> if you want to\nsee it.</p>\n<p>Go has been fun to learn because linting and a package manager\nare built into the command line. It also has code testing\nand benchmarks built in which feels nice having a \"standard\"\nlibrary for.</p>\n<p>But yeah, I felt like I needed to give javascript a break for\na little bit. Maybe I'll do some more Java stuff soon or write\nsomething with python cause I never really use that.</p>\n<p>Anyways that's it for now, I'll post again later.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/blog/2018-11-17LearningGoAndStuff/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"November 17, 2018","title":"Learning go and stuff"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}}
