It seems like something\nevery kid dreams about: visions of being able to do whatever you want\nwithout people telling you otherwise. Countless times, my parents\nwould promise me the ability to do something when I'm older. They would\nbrush it off and say \"wait until you're an adult,\" or \"maybe when you're\nolder.\" This led me to a seemingly false notion that as soon as I turn\n18, I would become an adult and thus be able to do what I want.</p>\n<p>From a strictly biological perspective, adult means to have reached\nsexual maturity. Girls can usually achieve this by 15-17 years old\nand boys usually do it by 16-17 years old. This seems to mostly fit\nOxford's definition: \"a person who is fully grown or developed.\" Of\ncourse, your brain doesn't stop developing until about 25 years old.</p>\n<p>Then there is legal adulthood. This is what I believe most people,\nespecially those just graduating high school believe in. Most of the time,\npeople reach legal adulthood at the age of 18. This is when a child's\nparents lose their parenting rights and can no longer make decisions\nfor and in behalf of their child. The child is now legally responsible\nfor themselves.</p>\n<p>However, a special problem tends to arise with teens who become the age\nof majority. The teen mind is already one that is trying to become more\nindependent. Because the frontal lobe is not fully developed yet, this\nis fuled largely out of emotion. Along with this engrained belief that\nthey are an \"adult\" as soon as they turn 18, many teens will struggle\nwith their parents at this point. \"Why should my parents be able to\ntell me what to do if I'm an adult?\"</p>\n<p>Perhaps this emotion-fuled desire for independence is what made me so\nupset when I insisted that I was an adult, but my aunt said \"You'll be\nan adult when you're married with kids.\" However, she might have a point.\nAmong the things I wasn't taught in school, was the social construct of\nadulthood. Which, in fact, adults like my aunt seem to understand a lot\nbetter than I do.</p>\n<p>Social adulthood is not defined anywhere. It is a subjective construct\nthat is influenced by things such as culture, gender, race, social class,\nand ethnicity. Like my aunt said, marriage and parenthood are typical\nsocial markers of adulthood. Others include living away from family,\ncompleting your education, and starting a career. Social adulthood\nrequires work. You have to put in some work to achieve markers for adulthood.\nIf you don't others may not recognize you as such.</p>\n<p>Perhaps these different definitions of adulthood help to explain how sometimes\nit feels as though people who are around my age experience parents believing\nthey are adult enough for some things, but not for others. In the context\nof trying to go to the \"adult\" activites with relatives, I usually get shut down.\nThose are social activities and I probably don't fit the social definition of\nan adult quite yet. However, I have worked to develop applications before for Walmart.\nWas I adult enough for that? Yes, because I have a near adult level of knowledge\nrequired for that.</p>\n<p>I believe that this is just one struggle that plagues college age students.\nWe are legally adults, but not socially. So what are we? We aren't kids, we aren't\nadults. It is a weird limbo that's a mixture of both and honestly, it can be very\nfrustrating at times, but perhaps that is my amygdala speaking instead of my frontal\nlobe.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/blog/2020-07-31WhatDoesitMeantobeanAdult/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"July 31, 2020","title":"What Does it Mean to be an Adult?"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}}
